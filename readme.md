### Kotlin Playground

This module serves as a playground for writing and running sample Kotlin code for testing and experimentation. Inspired
by [Kotlin Playground](https://play.kotlinlang.org), it allows you to run code directly in your IDE instead of a
browser, making it easier to try out external libraries and explore Kotlin in a flexible environment.

#### Running the Playground

Run the following Gradle command to start the playground. By default, Gradle runs
[Playground.kt](/kotlin-playground/src/main/kotlin/com/kotlin/playground/Playground.kt) since itâ€™s set as the main
class.

```shell
  ./gradlew kotlin-playground:run
```

#### Running the Tests

The tests are located in the `src/test` directory under the `com.kotlin.playground` package. Run the following Gradle
command to execute the tests.

```shell
  ./gradlew kotlin-playground:test
```

### Compose Playground

This module serves as a playground for writing and running sample Compose code for testing and experimentation. It
allows you to run code right in your IDE, making it easier to try out external libraries and explore Compose in a
flexible environment.

### Running the Playground

Run the following Gradle command to start the playground. By default, Gradle runs
[Playground.kt](/compose-playground/src/jvmMain/kotlin/com/compose/playground/Playground.kt) since itâ€™s set as the main
class.

```shell
  ./gradlew compose-playground:run
```

### Thank You ðŸ™Œ

I'm glad you checked out this repository. I understand the struggle of learning a new language or transitioning to
another one. I've been there. But believe me: youâ€™ll soon start loving Kotlin more than anything.

When I first started programming, I loved Java and JavaScript. I never imagined that Kotlin would replace them for me,
but here I am. Now, all other languages feel awkward to me. All the best, and welcome to the world of Kotlin. And thank
you so much for checking out this repository.
